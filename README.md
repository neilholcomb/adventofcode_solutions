# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code Solutions ðŸŽ„

## Spoiler alert!

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/). I've
saved them here for posterity. You should really just go play along though!

To get started clone this repository and then run `yarn start`

Everything is developed by using `jest` to run the test cases, simply alter an
example...or duplicate the code and tweak to learn how they work.

### Obfuscated code

When I first learned to code, I would read
[Obfuscated Perl Contest entries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscated_Perl_Contest).
These where code solutions made to be as hard to read as possible.

As I have worked through these examples I have tried to boil each down to a
single line solution. The last solution in each day is the most compact I could
come up with. They are not made to be hard to read, but that is a side effect of
coding as terse as possible. I would love to see PR's for any way to reduce
these examples even further.
